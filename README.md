# Playlister-Full-Stack

This is a full-stack application made using the MERN stack that allows you to create and edit playlists filled with songs that link to YouTube to play.
The application works by pinging a backend server made using Node.js and Express.js which then routes to a database made with MongoDB to get the playlists, and then presents all this information in a friendly UI using React.js. There are a multitude of features in the application from adding, editing, and removing playlists and songs by directly updating the database and then updating the page using our backend, to a transaction manager to undo and redo changes as well as conveniences like Control/Command + Z and Control/Command + Y functionality to undo and redo changes, respectively.
